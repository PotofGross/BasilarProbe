%[RESPONSE,PHASE] = fftpoint(TIMEDOMAINSIGNAL,SAMPLINGRATE,FREQUENCY)
%   Magnitude and phase from FFT of time domain waveform (sinusoid) at
%   particular Frequency. Returns frequency domain
%   content of a sampled TIMEDOMAINSIGNAL at the specified
%   FREQUENCY.  Only positive frequencies are returned. Voltages are
%   preserved. If TIMEDOMAINSIGNAL is a matrix, then each column must
%   represent a different waveform.
%
%   RESPONSE is a vector whose whose values are the zero to peak values
%   that correspond with the frequency. Each column represents a different
%   waveform.
%  
%   PHASE is a vector whose value correspond to phase of the signal in
%   radians for the frequency in FREQUENCY. Each column represents a
%   different waveform.
